# Problem 5 - Explanation

Dictionaries were the obvious choice here because they allow you to return all the keys (and all the key/value pairs) easily. We can then iterate over them.

The `insert` method time complexity is `O(n)` and the space complexity is `O(n)`

The `find` method time complexity is `O(n)` and the space complexity is `O(n)`

Tries have `O(n)` time complexity and `O(1)` space complexity
